Tasks that this project implements and studies:

1. Draw a chart showing the relation between P, C, and K according to this cipher. 
2. Implement the above cipher and calculate the cipher text for the plaintext provided in 
Appendix I using the two keys provided in Appendix II.
3. Measure the avalanche effect for the encryption algorithm using the provided plaintexts 
and keys. Change 1 bit in the input and calculate the percentage of how many bits are 
changed in the cipher text. Repeat this for the provided 10 plaintext inputs; this will give 
10 x 16 x 2 rounds. Calculate the average avalanche effect.
4. Suggest a change to the encryption algorithm to enhance the avalanche effect.  Repeat 
3 and comment on your findings.
